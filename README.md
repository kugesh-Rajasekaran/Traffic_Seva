AUTOMATED COMPOSITE DOCUMENT VERIFICATION SYSTEM USING MICROSERVICES
1.Now a days traffic police officers have hectic work of survilling the entire city, in addition to that all the documents of the driver and vehicle should be verified manually.
2.This method of checking not only puts burden on traffic police officers but also for commuters.
3.To rectify this we automate the entire verification process that includes person verification, vehicle verification and police verification through driver'sÂ  Aadhar id.
4.Through driver's Aadhar number we can verify other documents namely driving license, insurance etc..,
5.In addition to that we created other features like fine system, ticketing system, alert system etc..,
